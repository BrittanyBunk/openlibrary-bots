# OL Modern Books Importer

This provides a framework for an import pipeline driven by modern ISBNs.

ISBN lists (*.lst) are placed in the `in` directory and are imported into Open Library.

Once completed, the list is moved to the `done` directory.

Logs for each processed list are written to `log`.
