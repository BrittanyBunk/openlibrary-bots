## Overview

Open Library is an effort started in 2006 to create "one web page for every book ever published". It provides access to many public domain and out-of-print books, which can be read online.

## Developer's Guide

For instructions on administrating your Open Library instance and build instructions for developers, refer the Developer's [Getting Started with Bots](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Writing-Bots) Guide.

You can also find more information regarding Developer Documentation for Open Library in the Open Library [Wiki](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/)

Typically every folder signifies a different bot. The folder must contain code with respect to the bot, a `README.md` file which tells the user how to run the bot and any dependecies or `requirements.txt` file which can make it easier for a user to run the bot.
